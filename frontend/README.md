## About The Web Application

Our application is a platform for All-In-One staff to apply for open positions within the organisation based on skills that they have currently acquired from the organisation's internal Learning Management System (LMS) and Learning Journey Planning (LJP) System. HR, respective managers or directors will be able to view the applicants for these open positions that they are looking to fill. HR will also be able to list out open roles in the organisation.
